Intoduction
In the field of analytics one is required to work with data in feasible and beneficial
ways.Analytics being a three step process: the first step being data mining which includes
collection of data using primary and secondary research, second step being data warehousing
that is storing of data and then comes performing analytics on the data.The project is based
on a common problem faced by many a individuals of buying/selling/renting a real estate
property.
The project automates the record keeping of property to be sold/to-let and allows potential
customers to browse for property details and buy/rent the property via a real estate agent.
Apart from automatizing the record keeping of estate the project makes the real estate deal
transparent where customer gets to see and check how his or her money is being utilized.
This also takes care of the problem of unfair brokerage fees being demanded by real estate
agents
